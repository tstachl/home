# Meili (Mɛile)

> In Norse mythology, Meili (Old Norse: [ˈmɛile], 'the lovely one'[1]) is a god, son of the god Odin and Jörð, and brother of the god Thor. Meili is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. Other than Meili's relation to Odin and Thor, no additional information is provided about the deity in either source.
